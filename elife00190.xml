Each protein extends a polypeptide tail into the cell cytoplasm. When a protein is to be removed from the cell surface, its tail recruits a protein complex known as the AP2 adaptor to the membrane. AP2 then recruits a coat protein called clathrin, which forms a spherical scaffold around the adaptor, the target protein and the surrounding membrane, enclosing them inside a vesicle that breaks off from the membrane and enters the cell.</p><p>Endocytosis is particularly common in neurons, which use it as a means of recycling proteins at synapses&#x2014;the contact points between nerve cells. However, it is unclear whether synaptic-vesicle recycling also involves clathrin and AP2. To address this question, Gu et al. examined mutant nematode worms (<italic>C. elegans</italic>) in which the composition of AP2 had been altered.</p><p>AP2 has four subunits, called &#x3b1;, &#x3b2;2, &#x3bc;2 and &#x3c3;2, and Gu et al. produced worms that lack either the &#x3b1;- or &#x3bc;2-subunit, or both. Few worms that lacked both subunits survived. Surprisingly, however, worms that lacked just one subunit were viable, despite previous evidence that AP2 requires all four subunits to be functional. Nevertheless, these single mutants produced 30% fewer synaptic vesicles compared to wild-type worms. To examine the consequences of both subunits being absent, Gu et al. rescued the double mutants by selectively expressing AP2 in their skin. These animals&#x2014;which still lack AP2 in their nervous systems&#x2014;produced 70% fewer synaptic vesicles than their wild-type counterparts.</p><p>The results show that AP2 does not need all four of its subunits and that it can exist as two semi-independent hemicomplexes. Moreover, Gu et al. show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> uses at least two endocytotic mechanisms (AP2-dependent and independent) to recycle vesicles and so maintain synaptic function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00190.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00190.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>apa-2</kwd><kwd>apm-2</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle endocytosis</kwd><kwd>AP2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>C. elegans</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id>NS034307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jorgensen</surname><given-names>Erik M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id>GM067237</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Barth D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>1.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A protein complex that enables cells to transport substances across their membranes, and that typically consists of four subunits, can also function as two hemicomplexes, each with two subunits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins on the surface of cells are removed from the plasma membrane by endocytosis. Many cargo proteins are recruited to sites of endocytosis by the tetrameric adaptor complex AP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mahaffey et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Traub, 2003</xref>). The adaptor complex in turn recruits the coat protein clathrin to the membrane. Clathrin converts the raft of cargo and adaptor proteins into a budding vesicle by forming a scaffold that shapes the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mashl and Bruinsma, 1998</xref>). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis probably functions in all tissues, but it is unclear whether this process is suited to the particularly high rates of endocytosis required at nerve terminals. Nonetheless, the predominant mechanism for synaptic vesicle endocytosis is thought to be mediated via AP2 and clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dittman and Ryan, 2009</xref>). Testing this model by disrupting clathrin is difficult to interpret because trafficking from the trans-Golgi relies in part on clathrin-coated vesicles. Thus, genetic analysis of AP2 mutants is more specific for endocytic trafficking of proteins from the cell surface.</p><p>The AP2 adaptin complex has four subunits&#x2014;two large subunits &#x3b1; and &#x3b2;2, a medium subunit &#x3bc;2, and a small subunit &#x3c3;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsui and Kirchhausen, 1990</xref>). It is generally thought that adaptor complexes act as obligate tetramers; loss of one subunit will destabilize the entire complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dell&#x27;Angelica et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kantheti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Collins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Motley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Traub, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakatsu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mitsunari et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Ryan, 2009</xref>). AP2 functions at the plasma membrane as an interaction hub for transmembrane cargoes, accessory proteins, and clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Traub, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson, 2004</xref>). Loss of single AP2 subunits is known to disrupt endocytosis at the plasma membrane. A null allele in &#x3b1;-adaptin is lethal and leads to an absence of synaptic vesicles at neuromuscular junctions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and thus appears to disrupt endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalez-Gaitan and Jackle, 1997</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> loss of either of &#x3b1;- or &#x3b2;-adaptin by RNA interference perturbs the endocytosis of yolk protein from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grant and Hirsh, 1999</xref>). These data suggest that loss of either large subunit eliminates AP2 function.</p><p>Recent data suggest that the medium subunit &#x3bc;2 may not play an essential role for the endocytosis of synaptic vesicle components from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Ryan, 2009</xref>). Although &#x3bc;2 is required in part for the localization of clathrin at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu et al., 2008</xref>), synaptic vesicles and constituent proteins are still recycled in the absence of &#x3bc;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Ryan, 2009</xref>). These contrasting results for &#x3b1;-adaptin vs &#x3bc;2-adaptin mutants from different organisms suggest that &#x3b1;-adaptin is essential for synaptic vesicle endocytosis, whereas the &#x3bc;2 subunit may not be essential.</p><p>Here we evaluate the function of AP2 at synapses by studying mutations in &#x3b1;- and &#x3bc;2-adaptins in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Because null mutations for both of these genes are viable, we can compare the loss of these AP2 subunits in a single organism for the first time. Mutants lacking &#x3b1;-adaptin retain a partially functional AP2 hemicomplex consisting of &#x3bc;2 and &#x3b2;-adaptin. Mutants lacking both &#x3b1; and &#x3bc;2 subunits exhibit a more severe phenotype than the single mutants and are subviable. These results suggest that the single subunits retain some function, but that the double mutants lack all AP2 function. Nevertheless a moderate level of synaptic transmission remains in the double mutant and is able to sustain locomotory behavior, suggesting the presence of an AP2 independent mechanism capable of maintaining synaptic transmission at the synapse.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>&#x3b1;-adaptin mutations</title><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, &#x3b1;-adaptin is encoded by the <italic>apa-2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Yolk is a lipoprotein particle composed of lipids and lipid-transport proteins called vitellogenins. Yolk particles are synthesized and secreted by the intestine and are then taken up from the extracellular space by maturing oocytes via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Yolk endocytosis is clathrin-dependent and can be assayed in animals expressing GFP-tagged vitellogenin-2 (YP170::GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grant and Hirsh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato et al., 2009</xref>). In wild-type worms, YP170::GFP is enriched in the three most mature oocytes near the spermatheca. In &#x3b1;-adaptin mutants, the number of GFP-positive oocytes is decreased to one or two cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), which is similar to the defect in &#x3bc;2 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu et al., 2008</xref>). By contrast, strong defects in YP170::GFP endocytosis are observed in mutants lacking the alternative clathrin adaptor Disabled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmes et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the AP2 complex appears to assist Disabled for yolk endocytosis, and &#x3b1;- and &#x3bc;2-adaptin do not contribute differentially to this process.

By contrast, in AP2 adaptin mutants, synaptic vesicle proteins are not grossly mislocalized. Synaptotagmin, the vesicular GABA transporter (UNC-47), and synaptogyrin are largely confined to synaptic varicosities in &#x3b1;-adaptin single mutants and &#x3b1;-&#x3bc;2 adaptin double mutants, although the GFP signal is slightly diffuse in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).

The double mutants exhibit a more severe, 42% reduction in the amplitude of the evoked responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).

The results indicate that AP2 can function as two hemicomplexes comprised of either the &#x3b1;/&#x3c3; subunits or &#x3bc;/&#x3b2; subunits. The evidence for hemicomplexes is the following: First, in &#x3b1;-adaptin mutants, the &#x3bc;2-&#x3b2; subunits are stable, but the small &#x3c3;2 subunit is unstable. Second, in &#x3bc;2-adaptin mutants, &#x3b1;-&#x3c3;2 subunits are stable, but the &#x3b2; subunits are unstable. Third, specific cargoes require the cognate hemicomplex for endocytosis. Fourth, the subunits contribute genetically independent functions to viability, body morphology and synaptic vesicle biogenesis. Although our data suggest that AP2 hemicomplexes can function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, it must be emphasized that they are not fully independent; each hemicomplex is less stable in the absence of the other. Nonetheless<italic>,</italic> a complete block of AP2 function requires the simultaneous removal of both &#x3b1;- and &#x3bc;2-adaptins.</p><p>Below, we discuss four aspects of these results: What is the structural basis for hemicomplex function? What is the functional division of hemicomplexes? Can hemicomplexes function in other organisms? How can synapses function in the absence any AP2 function?</p><p>Recent structural studies support the possibility of stable hemicomplexes. Previous trypsin-sensitivity experiments suggested that AP2 undergoes a conformational change between the cytosolic and clathrin-bound states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsui and Kirchhausen, 1990</xref>). The crystal structures of both the closed and open conformations have been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Collins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). In the open state, &#x3bc;2-adaptin is postulated to undergo a large-scale conformational change; this rearrangement brings the four PIP2 binding sites and two endocytic motif binding sites of AP2 into a single plane. In this open conformation, the interactions between the C-terminal &#x3bc;2 domain and &#x3b1; and &#x3c3;2 are lost, and the binding surface between the C-terminal domain of &#x3bc;2 and &#x3b2; is doubled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). This implies that upon cargo binding, the interaction between &#x3bc;2 and &#x3b2; is strengthened while the contacts with the other half of the complex are weakened. It is possible that upon cargo binding the AP2 complex becomes two loosely connected hemi-complexes.</p><p>What is the functional relationship between the hemicomplexes? There are three possibilities: inseparable functions, separable functions, and redundant functions. First, some functions seem to require both hemi-complexes combined, and it is surprising that loss of one hemicomplex does not eliminate all AP2 function. For example, recruitment of AP2 to membranes in vitro requires both PIP2 binding sites on &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, PIP2 binding sites on each of the hemicomplexes may be sufficient for membrane association albeit with a lowered avidity. Second, other AP2 functions may be uniquely provided by each hemicomplex. Substrate binding in some cases is subunit-specific and loss of one hemicomplex preferentially affects a cargo protein, for example, MIG-14 is not recruited in a &#x3bc;2 adaptin mutant. On the cytoplasmic side, the ear of the alpha subunit preferentially binds particular ancillary proteins like amphiphysin, synaptojanin, Numb, and stonin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Owen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Santolini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Praefcke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2007</xref>), whereas clathrin heavy chain binds the appendage of &#x3b2; strongly and only binds the &#x3b1; appendage weakly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shih et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Owen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, loss of a single hemicomplex will result in the loss of only a specific subset of AP2 functions. Third, some functions might be mediated by either subunit, and only a double mutant would lead to a severe phenotype. For example, the appendage domains of both large subunits bind some of the same proteins, for example AP180, epsin, and eps15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Owen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mishra et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, redundancy need not act only at the level of AP2 subunits but could be contained within the network of associated proteins. Although clathrin is largely recruited to AP2 by the &#x3b2; subunit, even in the absence of &#x3b2;, it could still be recruited indirectly to the complex via AP180&#x2014;the web of interactions within the clathrin complex generates a redundant network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Royle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, in contrast to un-networked hubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeong et al., 2001</xref>), the loss of the hub does not cause things to fall apart; the center can hold.</p><p>Are functional hemicomplexes conserved? Certainly the sequences of the AP2 subunits are strongly conserved. For example, the amino acid sequences of AP2 subunits in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mouse are at least 64% identical (&#x3b1; 65%; &#x3b2;2 64%; &#x3bc;2 82%; &#x3c3;2 95%). It is also possible that the ability of AP2 hemicomplexes to function is also conserved. A purified human &#x3b1;-&#x3c3;2 hemicomplex can bind di-leucine motifs, suggesting that hemicomplexes can be stable and exhibit appropriate biochemical interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doray et al., 2007</xref>). Although double mutants have not been analyzed in other metazoans, a genome-wide genetic interaction analysis in <italic>S. pombe</italic> found that mutations in AP2 &#x3b2;2 and &#x3c3;2 exhibited synthetic interactions in double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frost et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that functional hemicomplexes may be conserved in other organisms. On the other hand, knocking down the &#x3bc;2 subunit in cultured hippocampal neurons caused a concomitant 96% reduction of &#x3b1;-adaptin suggesting that hemicomplexins are not stable in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Ryan 2009</xref>). It is likely that the stability of hemicomplexes may vary in organisms depending on a variety of factors such as temperature, chaperones and degradation machinery.</p><p>What is the molecular role of AP2 in synaptic vesicle biogenesis? A reduction of synaptic vesicle numbers by 70% and the accumulation of large vesicles imply an important role of AP2 in endocytosis. These defects resemble those observed in synaptotagmin mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic> or after acute disruption of synaptotagmin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jorgensen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poskanzer et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, the synaptic phenotypes of mutants lacking stonin are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fergestad et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mullen et al., 2012</xref>). One possibility is that AP2 nucleates synaptic vesicle endocytosis with stonin and synaptotagmin. The synaptotagmin C2B domain binds AP2 via the mu-homology domain of &#x3bc;2-adaptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haucke et al., 2000</xref>), and the C2A domain binds the mu-homology domain of stonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that these proteins work together in a single process. In fact analysis of double mutants suggest that stonin and AP2 act in a similar process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mullen et al., 2012</xref>). In the simplest model, synaptotagmin recruits stonin and AP2 to the plasma membrane to recover synaptic vesicle components.</p><p>On the other hand, the AP2 double mutants lacking both &#x3b1;- and &#x3bc;2-adaptins exhibit remarkably normal locomotion and evoked currents. One is forced to conclude that despite an important role in endocytosis, that synaptic vesicles are still being generated in the absence of AP2. What process contributes to synaptic vesicle endocytosis when AP2 is missing? One possibility is that AP1 or AP3 could compensate for the loss of AP2. In the mouse, there is evidence that AP1could function at the synapse and substitute for AP2 in its absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Ryan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glyvuk et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively AP3 might be able to provide function in the absence of AP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blumstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Voglmaier et al., 2006</xref>). However, AP1 and AP3 are not likely to be recycling vesicles from the membrane at the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromuscular junctions. First, the presence of &#x3b2;-adaptin (shared by AP1) in the nerve ring is completely dependent upon the presence of &#x3bc;2; AP1 does not seem to be at the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Second &#x3bc;2-&#x3bc;3 double mutants do not exhibit a synthetic phenotype, suggesting that AP3 does not substitute for AP2 at <italic>C. elegans</italic> synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>It is more likely that the adaptor protein associated with the AP2 complex, such as AP180, mediates endocytosis in the absence of the AP2 complex. AP180 possesses functions remarkably similar to AP2. AP180 can bind and stimulate clathrin assembly and bind PIP2 in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ford et al., 2001</xref>). It acts as an adaptor for synaptic vesicle proteins since it can bind and recruit synaptobrevin to invaginating vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nonet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller et al., 2011</xref>). Finally AP180 mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibit defects in synaptic vesicle endocytosis as analyzed by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nonet et al., 1999</xref>). It is possible that the remaining functional synaptic vesicles in the absence of AP2 are generated by AP180.</p><p>Where then does AP2 act? Classic studies of synaptic ultrastructure of frog and fly synapses suggest that clathrin and the AP2 complex act at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalez-Gaitan and Jackle, 1997</xref>). The data presented here do not contradict those studies, but also suggest that synaptic vesicle proteins and membrane can be recovered from the membrane despite a loss of AP2. The most prominent defect observed in AP2 mutants is the presence of large diameter vesicles and vacuoles in the synapses of the &#x3b1;-&#x3bc;2 adaptin double mutants. In some cases these vacuoles appear to be attached to the plasma membrane at the adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8&#x2014;figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting a defect in the formation and cleavage of vesicles from the plasma membrane. In other cases, reconstructions of these vacuoles from serial electron micrographs indicate that they are separated from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). These data suggest that AP2 has a late function; AP2 may be required to regenerate synaptic vesicles from endosomes.</p><p>In summary, these data suggest two major conclusions: First, the AP2 complex can function as two semi-independent hemicomplexes, consistent with new structural data for the complex. Second, there are at least two mechanisms (AP2-dependent and AP2-independent) for endocytosis at synapses in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that regenerate synaptic vesicles and maintain synaptic function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and screens</title><p>The wild type is Bristol N2.

To briefly summarize, 10 young adult hermaphrodites were placed into a freezing cup (100 &#xb5;m well of type A specimen carrier) containing space-filling bacteria, covered with a type B specimen carrier flat side down, and frozen instantaneously in the BAL-TEC HPM 010 (BAL-TEC, Liechtenstein). The frozen animals were fixed in the Leica AFS device with 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.1% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone for 2 days at &#x2212;90&#xb0;C and for 38.9 more hr with a gradual increase in temperature (5 &#xb0;C/hr to &#x2212;20&#xb0;C over 14 hr, constant temperature at &#x2212;20&#xb0;C for 16 hr, and 10 &#xb0;C/hr to 20&#xb0;C over 4 hr). The fixed animals were embedded in epon-araldite resin following the infiltration series (30% epon-araldite/acetone for 4 hr, 70% epon-araldite/acetone for 5 hr, 90% epon-araldite/acetone overnight, and pure epon-araldite for 8 hr). Mutant and control blocks were blinded. Ribbons of ultra-thin (33 nm) serial sections were collected using an Ultracut six microtome at the level of the anterior reflex of the gonad. Images were obtained on a Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope using a Gatan digital camera. Two hundred and fifty ultra-thin, contiguous sections were cut, and the ventral nerve cord was reconstructed from two animals representing each genotype. Image analysis was performed using Image J software. The numbers of synaptic vesicles (&#x223c;30 nm), dense-core vesicles (&#x223c;40 nm) and large vesicles (&#x3e;40 nm) in each synapse were counted. Their distances from the presynaptic specialization and the plasma membrane, as well as their diameters, were measured in acetylcholine neurons VA and VB and the GABA neuron VD. A synapse &#x2018;profile&#x27; is defined as a single section that passes through the dense projection at a neuromuscular junction. Profiles are used for quantifying synaptic vesicle numbers at synapses (in fact, it uses a section that passes through the middle of the synapse as a representative section of the synapse). A &#x2018;synapse&#x27; encompasses adjacent serial sections containing a dense projection (usually four sections). Sections on either side of that density were also included if they contained synaptic vesicle numbers above the average number of synaptic vesicles per profile. &#x2018;Synapse&#x27; reconstructions are used for quantifying the presence of large vesicles or vacuoles associated with the dense projection; since there is usually only one such structure per synapse, partial reconstructions of the synapse are required to reliably identify these structures. Two-tailed Student&#x27;s <italic>t</italic>-test was used for vesicle numbers and Mann-Whitney U test was used for vesicle diameters.</p><p>For synaptic modeling, we aligned 10 consecutive sections of an acetylcholine neuron from <italic>apm-2 apa-2</italic> double mutant using an imageJ plugin called TrakEM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cardona et al., 2012</xref>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22723842">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22723842</ext-link>). Plasma membranes, large vacuole membranes, and dense projections were traced using a paint brush tool. Synaptic vesicles and large vesicles are created using a &#x2018;ball&#x27; tool. The size of each vesicle is set by its diameter. The reconstructed volume was displayed in the 3D viewer. The plasma membrane and vacuole membrane were smoothed multiple times. The transparency of synaptic vesicles was set to 20%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> were grown at room temperature (22&#x2013;24 &#xb0;C) on agar plates with a layer of OP50 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Adult hermaphrodite animals were used for electrophysiological analysis. Postsynaptic currents (mPSCs and ePSCs) at the NMJ were recorded as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). To recapitulate, an animal was immobilized on a sylgard-coated glass coverslip by applying a cyanoacrylate adhesive along the dorsal side. A longitudinal incision was made in the dorsolateral region. After clearing the viscera, the cuticle flap was folded back and glued to the coverslip, exposing the ventral nerve cord and two adjacent muscle quadrants. A Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with a 40&#xd7; water immersion lens and 15&#xd7; eyepieces were used for viewing the preparation. Borosilicate glass pipettes with a tip resistance of 3&#x2013;5 M&#x3a9; were used as electrodes for voltage clamping. The classical whole-cell configuration was obtained by rupturing the patch membrane of a gigaohm seal formed between the recording electrode and a body wall muscle cell. The cell was voltage-clamped at &#x2013;60 mV to record mPSCs and ePSCs. ePSCs were evoked by applying a 0.5 ms square wave current pulse at a supramaximal voltage (25 V) through a stimulation electrode placed in close apposition to the ventral nerve cord. Postsynaptic currents were amplified with a Heka EP10 amplifier (InstruTECH) and acquired with Patchmaster software (HEKA). Data were sampled at a rate of 10 kHz after filtering at 2 kHz. The recording pipette solution contained the following (in mM): 120 KCl, 20 KOH, 5 TES, 0.25 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 36 sucrose, 5 EGTA, and 4 Na2ATP. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH, and the osmolarity was 310&#x2013;320 mOsm. The standard external solution included the following (in mM): 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 sucrose, 10 glucose and 15 HEPES, with the pH adjusted to 7.35 using NaOH and an osmolarity of 330&#x2013;340 mOsm.</p><p>The amplitude and frequency of mPSCs were analyzed using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA). A detection threshold of 10 pA was used in initial automatic analysis, followed by visual inspections to include missed events (&#x2265;5 pA) and to exclude false events resulting from baseline fluctuations. Amplitudes of ePSCs were measured with Fitmaster (HEKA). The amplitude of the largest peak of ePSCs from each experiment was used for statistical analysis. Data were imported into Origin, version 7.5 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA), for graphing and statistical analysis. An unpaired t test was used for statistical comparisons. A value of p&#x3c;0.05 is considered statistically significant. All values are expressed as the mean &#xb1; the SEM n is the number of worms from which recordings were taken.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Thrashing assay</title><p>A single worm was placed into a 50 &#x3bc;l drop of M9 solution.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of <italic>eLife&#x27;s</italic> Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Graeme Davis (Reviewing editor); Tim Ryan (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers&#x27; reports.</p><p>All three of the reviewers agree that the data set is strong, particularly the diversity of approaches and strong genetic data used to demonstrate that APA-2 and APM-2 are both required for endocytosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. All agree that the data will appeal to a wide audience. Two reviewers are strongly supportive of the manuscript and suggest minor textual modifications. A third reviewer has suggested additional experiments and textual revisions. The additional experiments that were suggested would directly test the hemi-complex model using labeled cargos specific for each hemi-complex. While these experiments would significantly strengthen the manuscript, they are not required for publication. When revising your manuscript, please address the textual revisions suggested by each reviewer, listed below.</p><p><bold>Suggested experiments to improve the manuscript:</bold></p><p>One could imagine that different endocytic cargos could have differential sensitivity to AP2 perturbations. An experiment would be to test cargos that are solely trafficked by either hemi-complex. This could be done using chimeric CD4 proteins containing either di-leucine (as in Figure 4) or tyrosine-based endocytic motifs (which mediate binding to alpha2 and mu2 respectively). If hemi-complexes function independently, di-leucine substrate recycling would be disrupted in apa-2 (as indicated in Figure 4D) but unaffected in apm-2 (which was not tested). The converse pattern would be expected for cargos containing a tyrosine endocytic motif. In principle, these experiments could persuasively show that in mutants lacking specific subunits, the remaining AP2 subunits have the capacity to function as hemi-complexes.</p><p><bold>Required textual revisions:</bold></p><p>1) Please revise the text to make it as clear as possible how much residual AP2 function may exist in the hemi knockouts.</p><p>2) Please discuss the contribution of hemi-complex function to the wild type animal, when all subunits are present. For example, AP2 binding to cargo endocytic motifs is activated by PIP2 binding, which is mediated by residues in both hemi-complexes. Clathrin recruitment by AP2 is mediated by clathrin binding sequences in both hemi-complexes. Native cargoes may contain motifs that bind both alpha and mu subunits. For these reasons, the avidity of the AP2 holo-complex for substrates and clathrin may be much stronger than for either hemi-complex. In addition, the authors should comment on the observation that protein abundance for the residual hemi-complex is relatively low (e.g., in the <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants), suggesting that it would be a minor contributor to wild-type endocytic activity. This is particularly the case if recruitment to the membrane is compromised for the hemi-complex.</p><p>3) Please revise the text to include p-values for all data upon which arguments or conclusions are based. This is particularly important for the diverse double mutant phenotypes that appear to trend toward significance, but which may or may not reach statistical significance. This is also the case when discussing comparisons being made regarding electrophysiological data.</p><p>4) It is unclear why the authors did not report on the electrophysiological signature of the double (alpha/mu) mutant in the &#x201c;skin&#x201d; rescued animals. This is worth at least mentioning.</p><p>5) The authors should reference the mammalian work showing that loss of mu2 leads to loss of alpha and point out that this is in contrast to the findings in this system.</p><p>6) It is not possible, at the light level, to know whether an altered axon/synapse ratio of protein distribution has anything to do with the recycling of individual proteins.

Consistent with the model, the substrate was strongly mislocalized in the <italic>apa-2</italic> &#x03B1; mutant, and weakly mislocalized in the <italic>apm-2</italic> &#x03BC;2 mutant. Images are shown in Figure 5D and the quantification is shown in Figure 5E. For a &#x03BC;2 substrate, we used MIG-14 / wntless, which we have previously shown requires &#x03BC;2 for endocytosis from the surface. In reciprocal experiments we found that MIG-14 endocytosis is more defective in &#x03BC;2 mutants than &#x03B1; mutants.

First, we quantified the levels of remaining AP2 subunits by western blot in each of the mutants (depending on the availability of functional antibodies; Figure 6&#x2014;figure supplements 1&#x26;2). Second, we quantified the fluorescence intensity of all four AP2 subunits at the nerve ring in &#x03B1; and &#x03BC;2 mutants Figure 6 and Table 1).</p><p><italic>2) Please discuss the contribution of hemi-complex function to the wild type animal, when all subunits are present.

This is particularly the case if recruitment to the membrane is compromised for the hemi-complex</italic>.</p><p>It is true, the holocomplex is likely to provide some inseparable functions, and even if completely stable, the function of a hemicomplex might be compromised. It is also important to note that the hemicomplexes are <italic>not</italic> fully stable. We now emphasize these two points in the new version of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) Please revise the text to include p-values for all data upon which arguments or conclusions are based. This is particularly important for the diverse double mutant phenotypes that appear to trend toward significance, but which may or may not reach statistical significance. This is also the case when discussing comparisons being made regarding electrophysiological data</italic>.</p><p>We double-checked our comparisons and have included all p-values in the legends of the figures or the figure supplements. To address the electrophysiological comparisons more precisely, we added the following text:</p><p>&#x201c;In <italic>apa-2(ox422)</italic> mutants, the amplitude from miniature spontaneously released vesicles (minis) is increased by 40% (Figure 9C). The mini amplitudes in the skin-rescued single and double mutants are also larger, although they do not reach statistical significance.&#x201d;</p><p><italic>4) It is unclear why the authors did not report on the electrophysiological signature of the double (alpha/mu) mutant in the &#x201c;skin&#x201d; rescued animals. This is worth at least mentioning</italic>.</p><p>The data for the skin-rescued double mutants are included in Figure 9. In the text we report the results as follows: &#x201c;The double mutants exhibit a more severe, 42% reduction in the amplitude of the evoked responses (Figure 9E).&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There is also a more severe reduction in the rates of tonic synaptic vesicle fusion. Skin-rescued <italic>apa-2</italic> animals exhibit a 50% reduction in mini frequency, and the skin-rescued <italic>apa-2 apm-2</italic> double mutants exhibit a 68% reduction in mini frequency (Figure 9D).&#x201d;</p><p><italic>5) The authors should reference the mammalian work showing that loss of mu2 leads to loss of alpha and point out that this is in contrast to the findings in this system</italic>.</p><p>We now note this difference in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>6) It is not possible, at the light level, to know whether an altered axon/synapse ratio of protein distribution has anything to do with the recycling of individual proteins. This should be discussed.</italic> In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> stonin / UNC-41 (Mullen et al., 2012) and AP180 / UNC-11 (Nonet et al., 1999) are two characterized adaptors for synaptotagmin and synaptobrevin recycling at synapses. In the absence of these adaptors, the tagged cargo protein is severely diffused into axons that make the fluorescence at the synaptic varicosities decrease or even out with that in axons. So we still believe that the axon/synapse ratio of protein distribution could reflect the efficiency of the cargo recycling to some extent. To make this point clear in the paper, we have made the following change:</p><p>&#x201c;In <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants lacking particular adaptor proteins, the cognate cargo protein diffuses into axons. For example in AP180 mutants, synaptobrevin is no longer concentrated at synapses but is diffuse in axons (Nonet et al., 1999). By contrast, in AP2 adaptin mutants, synaptic vesicle proteins are not grossly mislocalized.&#x201d;</p><p><italic>7) The changes in vesicle size and number are similar to that observed in synaptotagmin 1 mutants and following acute inactivation of synaptotagmin 1. This is worth citing since synaptic vesicle endocytosis is never directly assayed in the current study</italic>.</p><p>That is correct: acute inactivation of synaptotagmin at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction as well as chronic inactivation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits a similar phenotype as that found here for AP2 knockouts. Moreover, we previously found that stonin shares overlapping functions with AP2. We now discuss the relationship among synaptotagmin, AP2 and stoning in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>8) Figure 8C: &#x201c;These data suggest that the AP2 complex plays a role in regulating the size of synaptic vesicles.&#x201d; Does the defect in vesicle size imply a role for determining the size of the vesicle? Many endocytic mutations alter vesicle size and it is unlikely that all participate in the control of vesicle diameter. An alternative conclusion is that any mutation that disrupts the fidelity of endocytosis may well disrupt the ability to reliably generate small vesicles of a consistent size</italic>.</p><p>We have amended the text to state that the change in vesicle diameter might be indirect. In addition, to try to pinpoint where the defect in AP2 mutants might lie, we analyzed more sections and performed a 3D reconstruction of a synapse from the <italic>apa-2 apm-2</italic> double mutant. Defects are observed at the cell membrane in some cases, but the most prominent defects are large vacuoles present in the synaptic varicosity. We speculate that AP2 might have a late role in the regeneration of synaptic vesicles from endosomes. The changes are as follows: Results, &#x201c;These data suggest that the AP2 complex may play a role in regulating the size of synaptic vesicles. Alternatively, the effect on vesicle size may be indirect due to pleiotropic defects in endocytosis.&#x201d;</p><p>Discussion, &#x201c;The most prominent defect observed in AP2 mutants is the presence of large diameter vesicles and vacuoles in the synapses of the &#x03B1;-&#x03BC;2 adaptin double mutants. [&#x2026;] These data suggest that AP2 has a late function and possibly AP2 is required to regenerate synaptic vesicles from endosomes.&#x201d;</p></body></sub-article></article>
