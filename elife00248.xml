However, various &#x2018;super-resolution&#x2019; methods have allowed researchers to overcome this diffraction limit for fluorescence imaging, which is the most popular form of microscopy used in the life sciences. This approach involves tagging the biomolecules of interest with fluorescent molecules, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), so that they can be identified in cells. An excitation laser then drives the fluorescent molecule, which is also known as a fluorophore, into an excited state: after a short time, the fluorophore can return to its ground state by releasing a fluorescence photon. Images of the sample are built up by detecting these photons.</p><p>In STED super-resolution microscopy a second laser is used to instantly send the molecules from their excited or &#x2018;on&#x2019; states back to their ground or &#x2018;off&#x2019; states before any fluorescence can occur. The second laser beam is usually shaped like a doughnut, with a small region of low light intensity surrounded by a region of much higher intensity. STED microscopy is able to beat the diffraction limit because the second laser turns all the fluorophores &#x2018;off&#x2019; except those in the small sub-wavelength region at the centre of the doughnut. The image is build up by scanning both lasers over the sample so that the small region in which the fluorophores are &#x2018;on&#x2019; probes the entire cell.</p><p>RESOLFT is a similar technique that employs fluorescent molecules with &#x2018;on&#x2019; and &#x2018;off&#x2019; times that are much longer than those used in STED microscopy. In particular, RESOLFT uses fluorescent molecules that can be rapidly switched back and forth between long-lived &#x2018;on&#x2019; and &#x2018;off&#x2019; states many times by the two lasers. The fact that both these states are long-lived states means that RESOLFT requires much lower laser intensities than STED, which makes it attractive for imaging biological samples over large areas or long times.</p><p>RESOLFT demonstrated its suitability for bioimaging for the first time last year, with a protein called rsEGFP (reversibly switchable enhanced GFP) being employed as the fluorophore. However, the time needed to switch this protein between the &#x2018;on state&#x2019; and the &#x2018;off state&#x2019; was relatively long, and it took about an hour to record a typical image. Now, Grotjohann et al. have modified this protein to make a new fluorophore called rsEGFP2 with a shorter switching time, and have used it to image various structures&#x2014;including Vimentin, a protein that forms part of the cytoskeleton in many cells, and organelles called peroxisomes&#x2014;inside live mammalian cells. They were able to record these images some 25&#x2013;250 times faster than would have been possible with previous RESOLFT approaches. The combination of RESOLFT and rsEGFP2 should allow researchers to image a wide variety of structures and processes in living cells that have not been imaged before.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00248.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00248.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>confocal microscopy</kwd><kwd>fluorescent probes</kwd><kwd>GFP</kwd><kwd>nanoscopy</kwd><kwd>superresolution</kwd><kwd>live-cell imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft-Research Center for Molecular Physiology of the Brain</funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jakobs</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source>SFB 755 (Nanoscale Photonic Imaging)</funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jakobs</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>4.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The discovery of a fluorescent protein that can be rapidly switched between long-lived &#x2018;on&#x2019; and &#x2018;off&#x2019; states will lead to a new generation of super-resolution imaging experiments on living cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>While for many decades lens-based optical microscopy could not resolve features finer than half the wavelength of light (&#x3bb;/2 &#x3e; 200 nm), the recent development of fluorescence nanoscopy or super-resolution imaging methods boosted its resolution potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hell, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). In all these methods, the diffraction barrier is overcome by employing a fluorophore transition between two states, typically a fluorescent on- and a non-fluorescent off-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hell, 2009</xref>) in order to separate neighboring features. The method called RESOLFT differs from stochastic single fluorophore on-off-switching methods by the fact that a doughnut or a line pattern is scanned across the sample, determining at any point in time the nanosized coordinate range where the fluorophores are in the on-state. Using long lifetimes of the on- and off-states reduces the light intensities required for optical switching by orders of magnitude over the related STED approach, making RESOLFT attractive for extended live-cell or large area imaging.</p><p>Although it was suggested almost a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hell et al., 2003</xref>) and its viability shown in principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dedecker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schwentker et al., 2007</xref>) the wider applicability of RESOLFT nanoscopy to biological imaging has been demonstrated only recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brakemann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grotjohann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rego et al., 2012</xref>). The reason is that fluorescent protein based RESOLFT critically relies on reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) providing many on-off cycles, such as the recently designed rsEGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grotjohann et al., 2011</xref>). Unfortunately, in these demonstrations, the still relatively slow switching kinetics of rsEGFP entailed pixel dwell times of 10&#x2013;20 ms at switching light intensities of &#x7e;1 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Hence images of 10 &#xb5;m &#xd7; 10 &#xb5;m in size and a pixel step size of 20 nm required recording times of about an hour. In this study we describe the generation, characterization and application of a novel RSFP, namely rsEGFP2, which facilitates faster switching and, together with modifications of the initial switching scheme, enables 25&#x2013;250 faster RESOLFT recordings in living cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results|discussion" id="s2"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We observed that already the exchange of a single amino acid in the chromophore of the photostable and widely-used enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Patterson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tsien, 1998</xref>), namely replacing threonine 65 by alanine, transformed EGFP into a fast switching RSFP, which exhibited a &#x2018;negative switching mode&#x2019;. &#x2018;Negative switching&#x2019; RSFPs switch from the on- into the off-state at the wavelength, here &#x7e;480 nm, that is used to elicit fluorescence. The switching from the off-state into the on-state is achieved by irradiation with a different wavelength, here &#x7e;405 nm. Protein solutions of EGFP(T65A) exhibited a high residual fluorescence (&#x7e;50% of the on-state signal) when the protein solution was switched into the off-state. However, analysis of EGFP(T65A) demonstrated fast switching and low switching fatigue, indicating that the different chromophore (an Ala-Tyr-Gly chromophore instead of a Thr-Tyr-Gly chromophore) might provide additional possibilities for the generation of fast switching RSFPs. Hence, we also introduced the mutation A206K to ensure that the protein is a true monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zacharias et al., 2002</xref>) and introduced, alone or in combination, the four mutations that discriminate rsEGFP from EGFP. We screened this collection of EGFP variants for those exhibiting a high resistance against switching fatigue in combination with fast switching at light intensities previously used for RESOLFT (few kW/cm<sup>2</sup>). We found that introducing two mutations was sufficient to transform EGFP(T65A, A206K) into a novel RSFP with improved properties when compared to rsEGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We named this new variant (EGFP[T65A, Q69L, V163S, A206K]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>) reversibly switchable EGFP2 (rsEGFP2).

In the fluorescent state, a solution of rsEGFP2 exhibits an extinction coefficient of <italic>&#x3b5;</italic> &#x2248; 61,000 M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and a fluorescence quantum yield of <italic>&#x3a6;</italic><sub><italic>Fl</italic></sub> &#x3d; 0.3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Hence the brightness (given by <italic>&#x3b5; &#x3a6;</italic><sub><italic>Fl</italic></sub>) of rsEGFP2 is similar to that of rsEGFP and about 60% of that of EGFP at low light intensity irradiation. Single-molecule spectroscopy measurements performed at higher light intensities (5 to 100 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>) showed that the single molecule brightness of rsEGFP and rsEGFP2 were &#x7e;52% and &#x7e;44% of that of EGFP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>). The slight difference between brightness values determined at low and high light intensities may be attributed to the increased population of unidentified dark states at higher intensities. rsEGFP2 exhibits a &#x2018;negative&#x2019; switching mode, that is irradiation with light of around 480 nm induces fluorescence and, in a competing process, switches rsEGFP2 off. Subsequent irradiation with light of around 405 nm switches the protein back from the off- into the on-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Irradiation of a purified rsEGFP2 solution with light of &#x7e;480 nm leads to a decrease of the 483 nm absorption band, which presumably corresponds to the anionic (de-protonated) cis-chromophore, and to the onset of an absorption band peaking at 408 nm, presumably corresponding to the neutral (protonated) trans-chromophore state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andresen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andresen et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The single molecule brightness, that is the number of emitted photons per time unit, of rsEGFP and rsEGFP2 are similar. However, because a single switching cycle of rsEGFP2 is on average shorter than a single switching cycle of rsEGFP, rsEGFP2 emits fewer photons in a single cycle than rsEGFP.

To compare rsEGFP2 with rsEGFP in this regard, we immobilized purified proteins in polyacrylamide layers (PAA). Applying light intensities that have previously been used for RESOLFT (few kW/cm<sup>2</sup>), we recorded the fluorescence during 6,000 on-off switching cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The illumination times were adapted for the two proteins such that the signal reached a maximum or minimum in each cycle. We found that under these conditions the fluorescence was halved not before &#x7e;1,100 (rsEGFP) and &#x7e;2,100 (rsEGFP2) cycles, demonstrating that rsEGFP2 accommodates even more switches than rsEGFP.</p><p>In most negative switching RSFPs, including rsEGFP, the ensemble off-switching with blue light is slower by 2&#x2013;3 orders of magnitude, compared to the on-switching with UV light at comparable light intensities, rendering the off-switching the time-limiting step in RESOLFT microscopy. We compared the off-switching half-time (time after which the fluorescence signal is reduced to 50%) of rsEGFP2 and rsEGFP as a function of the off-switching light intensity (491 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We found that the difference in the off-switching halftimes of rsEGFP2 and rsEGFP depends on the light intensities applied. The lesser the light intensities, the more pronounced is the speed advantage of rsEGFP2. At a light intensity of 5.5 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> the off-switching of rsEGFP2 was &#x7e;6.5 times faster than the off-switching of rsEGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, inset). Presumably the switching speed advantage for rsEGFP2 is even higher at lower intensities. For undesirable intensities of &#x3e;100 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>, the differences between rsEGFP and rsEGFP2 are negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, inset). These measurements also revealed that the level to which the fluorescence intensity of an ensemble of rsEGFP2 proteins can be reduced (the off-state fluorescence), depends on the intensities for off-switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 3</xref>). Hence the light intensities and the irradiation times used for off-switching influence both the switching speed as well as the lowest residual fluorescence. Furthermore, we observed that the buffer conditions, most notably the pH, and the cellular environments also influence the absolute switching speed, potentially requiring adaptations of the illumination protocol to the observed samples.</p><p>In mammalian cells, rsEGFP2 can be fused to histone H2B and alpha-tubulin, which require a truly monomeric fusion tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Corroborating its monomeric nature, it migrates on semi-native gels in a single band of the expected size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>). rsEGFP2 maturates in vitro at 37&#xb0;C with a halftime of &#x7e;20 min, which is shorter or comparable to most conventional fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shaner et al., 2008</xref>) including mCherry (15 min), tdTomato (60 min) or TagRFP (100 min). Its maturation time is superior to both rsEGFP (3 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grotjohann et al., 2011</xref>) and a maturation-improved Dronpa(M159T) variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stiel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Willig et al., 2011</xref>) (&#x7e;50 min). Presumably because of its fast maturation time and due to the fact that its linker is identical to that of EGFP (which has been proven to be very suitable for the generation of fusion proteins) rsEGFP2 is well suited to tag proteins in living mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00248.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Expression of various functional rsEGFP2 fusion proteins in mammalian cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) rsEGFP2-KDEL (targeting to the ER), (<bold>B</bold>) Keratin19-rsEGFP2, (<bold>C</bold>) Histone H2B-rsEGFP2, (<bold>D</bold>) Vimentin-rsEGFP2, (<bold>E</bold>) Pex16-rsEGFP2, and (<bold>F</bold>) rsEGFP2-alpha-tubulin.

We first expressed rsEGFP2 fused to the C-terminus of Vimentin in mammalian PtK2 (<italic>Potorous tridactylis</italic>) cells. RESOLFT imaging was performed with a home-built setup maintaining the cells at 35&#xb0;C. Because the filaments formed by Vimentin-rsEGFP2 are relatively immobile, we selected an irradiation scheme encompassing low switching light intensities in combination with extended irradiation times. The living cells were imaged pixel-by-pixel, by first irradiating with 405 nm light (2 kW/cm<sup>&#xb2;</sup>) for 40 &#xb5;s to switch most proteins into their fluorescent on-state. After a short illumination break of 10 &#xb5;s, the doughnut shaped 491 nm beam (10 kW/cm<sup>&#xb2;</sup>, 300 &#xb5;s) was used to switch rsEGFP2 into the off-state, confining the on-state to the doughnut center. Finally, the rsEGFP2 fluorescence was probed for 30 &#xb5;s by irradiation with 491 nm light (38 kW/cm<sup>&#xb2;</sup>). Hence the pixel dwell time was 380 &#xb5;s, which is 25- to 50-fold faster than previously reported using rsEGFP on similar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grotjohann et al., 2011</xref>). To enhance the image contrast, we also employed Richardson-Lucy restoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Richardson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofmann et al., 2005</xref>). Movements of Vimentin-filaments in a living cell were recorded in 10 &#xb5;m &#xd7; 10 &#xb5;m frames of 20 nm pixel size, every 100 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="movie" rid="movie1">Movie 1</xref>).

Among the established methods, STED-microscopy entails relatively large intensities, (5&#x2013;200 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>), depending on the desired resolution. However, since the wavelengths (560&#x2013;800 nm) used for STED are in the comparatively benign long-wavelength part of the spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hell, 2009</xref>), STED microscopy can image living cells and tissues, including neurons in the cerebral cortex of a living mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berning et al., 2012</xref>). In the RSFP-based RESOLFT microscopy demonstrated here, the employed light intensities (1&#x2013;80 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>) are several orders of magnitude lower than in STED-microscopy and comparable to those used in live-cell confocal fluorescence microscopy. Stochastic single-molecule based approaches, such as the methods called PALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shroff et al., 2008</xref>), STORM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shim et al., 2012</xref>), and GSDIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">F&#xf6;lling et al., 2008</xref>), typically use similar light intensities for imaging living cells (0.1&#x2013;100 kW/cm<sup>&#xb2;</sup> depending on the exposure time or camera frame rate), but they apply these intensities (i.e. temporal and spatial photon densities) continuously to all points in the imaged area. Since our RESOLFT approach has been implemented as a point-scanning system, the intensities employed are applied only for a brief duration on a small, sub-micrometer sized region of the imaged area. Hence any pixel is only illuminated during a small fraction of the recording time of the image. In the stochastic methods, the whole imaged area is irradiated for the entire time of recording, that is for a couple of seconds or minutes. Therefore, in the RESOLFT microscopy demonstrated here, the total light dose impinging on the cell is lower by 3&#x2013;4 orders of magnitude compared to the stochastic single-molecule based approaches. Concretely, for recording the shown RESOLFT images, 2&#x2013;10 J/cm<sup>&#xb2;</sup> were applied for switching into the on-state, and 25&#x2013;300 J/cm<sup>&#xb2;</sup> for eliciting fluorescence and switching the protein off. PALM live-cell imaging reportedly requires light doses of 1,000&#x2013;100,000 J/cm<sup>&#xb2;</sup> for on-switching with UV (405 nm) light and 25,000&#x2013;300,000 J/cm<sup>&#xb2;</sup> for fluorescence excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shroff et al., 2008</xref>). Live-cell GSDIM experiments using a yellow fluorescent protein required even larger irradiation doses (100,000&#x2013;900,000 J/cm<sup>&#xb2;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">F&#xf6;lling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Testa et al., 2010</xref>). Although RESOLFT microscopy may induce phototoxicity after extended exposure, similarly to live-cell confocal microscopy, it currently is the superresolution method entailing the lowest light dose. Therefore, perhaps not surprisingly, RESOLFT microscopy has been used to image neurons in living organotypical hippocampal cultures over several hours without noticeable photodegradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Testa et al., 2012</xref>). Note that the comparatively low-dose/low-intensity requirement of the RESOLFT concept is due to the fact that it uses long-lived on- and off-states in combination with the fact that it does not require fast emission of many photons for establishing molecular coordinates (localization). Since the applied intensities are largely determined by the on-off switching kinetics, the concept offers ample room for accommodating novel proteins with switching kinetics entailing even lower light doses and intensities.</p><p>In conclusion, rsEGFP2 is a bright, monomeric, photostable, quickly maturating, and fast switching alternative to rsEGFP with comparatively low photobleaching. We expect it to outperform other green fluorescent RSFPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ando et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stiel et al., 2007</xref>) because of its faster maturation and good usability for functional protein tagging. An implementation of quick illumination sequences allowed us to realize up to 250-fold faster recordings as compared to previous reports, thus facilitating live-cell RESOLFT nanoscopy with pixel dwell times down to 70 &#xb5;s. Since one can adjust both the duration and the illumination intensity, as well as the optical switching scheme, RESOLFT nanoscopy allows one to adapt speed and resolution within a certain range, to the sample needs.</p><p>Finally, we note that in the point-scanning scheme used here, the total recording time of the image scales with the area of recording. Parallelization of the scanning procedure with an array of doughnuts or lines (so-called &#x2018;structured illumination&#x2019;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gustafsson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schwentker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rego et al., 2012</xref>) overcomes this dependence on the field of view and cuts down the recording time by the degree of parallelization. Owing to the low-light level operation, the degree of parallelization can easily amount up to a factor of 100&#x2013;1000. For this reason, given the short pixel dwell times attained herein, parallelized RESOLFT versions should enable video-rate nanoscopy across the whole field of view of the objective lens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mutagenesis</title><p>For site-directed mutagenesis, the QuikChange Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or a multiple-site mutagenesis approach using several primers were used.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Protein expression, purification and characterization</title><p>The experimental procedures were essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grotjohann et al., 2011</xref>).

The microscope utilized three separate beam paths for generating focal spots: two at 491 nm wavelength for excitation and off-switching and one at 405 nm for on-switching of the fluorophores. The two focal spots at 491 nm comprised: (i) a normal diffraction-limited focus with a Gaussian profile for reading out the fluorescence signal and (ii) a focus with a central intensity minimum (&#x2018;zero&#x2019;) for off-switching at the focal periphery in the xy-plane, obtained by passing the beam through a vortex phase mask (463 nm mask, vortex plate VPP-A, RPC Photonics, Rochester, NY). The first two foci were both generated by the same laser diode (50 mW, Calypso 50, Cobolt, Stockholm, Sweden). The third focal spot, again with a normal diffraction-limited Gaussian profile, was generated by a laser diode at 405 nm wavelength (30 mW, BCL-030-405-S, CrystaLaser, Reno, NV, USA) and used for the on-switching of rsEGFP2.</p><p>The microscope was equipped with a glycerol-immersion objective lens (PL APO, CORR CS, 63&#xd7;, 1.3NA, glycerol; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). A piezo system (ENV40/20, Piezosystem Jena, Jena, Germany) was used to move the objective lens along the optical axis. A separate piezo stage (NV40, Piezosystem Jena) was implemented to translate the sample with nanometer precision in the xy-plane. The fluorescence signal was filtered by a band pass filter (532/70 nm) and detected by an avalanche photo diode (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA); fluorescence photons were only allowed to be counted when the 491 nm read-out beam was switched on. The individual laser beam paths were triggered either by an acousto-optic modulator (MTS 130A3, Pegasus Optik GmbH, Wallenhorst, Germany) or by an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF.nC/TN, Pegasus Optik GmbH). The pulse sequence and duration were defined by a pulse generator (Model 9514, QUANTUM COMPOSERS, Bozeman, MT, USA) and triggered by a fast acquisition card (MCA-3 Series/P7882, FAST ComTec GmbH, Oberhaching, Germany) pixel by pixel.</p><p>Alternatively, we assembled the Abberior RESOLFT Quad P microscopy kit provided by Abberior Instruments GmbH, G&#xf6;ttingen, Germany, which used the same arrangement and wavelengths as the home-built system, except for the fact that scanning was accomplished by a galvanometer beam scanning system (Quad scanner) and the body of the microscope was an Olympus iX81 inverted microscope.
